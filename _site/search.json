    "text": "Water is fundamental to life, yet billions worldwide still lack access to safe drinking water and sanitation. As of 2022, 2.2 billion people lacked safely managed drinking water, while 3.5 billion had no access to safe sanitation. Waterborne diseases such as cholera and typhoid continue to pose serious public health threats, particularly in regions with inadequate water infrastructure. Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6) aims to ensure universal access to water and sanitation, but current progress is insufficient, requiring accelerated efforts to meet global targets.\nObjectives:\nThis project seeks to analyze and visualize global disparities in water accessibility, sanitation, and health outcomes. By leveraging statistical and geospatial analysis, we aim to:\n\nIdentify regions with severe water stress and sanitation deficiencies.\nAssess the relationship between water accessibility and waterborne diseases.\nForecast future trends in water safety and sanitation.\n\nApplication Features:\nOur team will develop an interactive web-based visual analytics application using Shiny to democratize data access and insights. The key features include:\n\nTreemap Visualisation: Displaying disparities in water stress, disease outbreaks, and investment gaps across regions, identify the trend and areas of concern.\nWASH-Based Health Trend Analysis: Forecasting WASH indicator(water stress, water sanitation, etc )and Health Indicator( DiarrheaRate, TyphoidRate) using combined PLM and Time Series Analysis (ARIMA).\nConfirmatory Data Analysis (CDA): Statistical validation of the relationship between water access, health outcomes.\nInteractive Dashboards: Allowing users to explore Region-level insights and trends over time.\n\nThis project aims to support efforts to ensure universal access to clean water and improve global health outcomes through data-driven approaches."

The following steps will be taken: \n\nData Cleaning:  \n\nHandling Missing value (removal of incomplete records) \nIdentify and remove duplicate records \nStandardize data formats (date formats, numerical conversions) \n\n\n\nFiltering and Transformation  \n\nSelect key variables relevant to the study, such as clean water access,\n\n\n\nData Integration\n\nMerge data on typhoid outbreaks (2000–2022) from the Center for Open Science (OSF), cholera cases from the WHO (2000–2023) via Kaggle (extra from WHO), and World Development Indicators (WDI) from the World Bank (2000–2023) to analyze the relationship between waterborne diseases and access to unsafe water sources. This integration will help assess how trends in cholera and typhoid correlate with water quality and accessibility over time.\nGeocode data for geospatial visualization"

This type of data, often called panel data or longitudinal data, involves multiple subjects (such as countries, individuals, or companies) observed over several time periods.\nFor this project, we are using data from the World Development Indicators (WDI) as WASH (Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene) indicators and data from the Institute for Health Metrics as health indicators. We will apply the PLM to estimate the coefficients of the WASH indicators for each health indicator. Subsequently, we will use time-series analysis to forecast trends for the health indicators, particularly disease rates, based on the coefficients obtained from the WASH indicators.\nTo apply PLM in our project, we will be using plm package in R."

Level of water stress appears as significant in most models, suggesting that regions facing higher water stress tend to experience worse health outcomes. People using safely managed drinking water services has significant positive impacts on DiarrheaRate and UnsafeRisk, but it is not significant for HepatitisRate.\nThe models explaining HepatitisRate and UnsafeRisk have very high R-squared values (above 94%), suggesting that these models explain most of the variance in the respective dependent variables.The DiarrheaRate model has a slightly lower R-squared (85.4%), but still a very good fit.\nThe results show that sanitation, drinking water access, and open defecation are important factors influencing health outcomes, particularly DiarrheaRate and UnsafeRisk.Water stress plays a critical role, indicating that regions with high water stress are likely to face more health-related challenges.There is considerable variation in the impact of predictors on different health outcomes, with some predictors (e.g., People using safely managed drinking water services) being more influential for some health outcomes than others."

Discussion on the Project Topic\nPrior to the meeting, we reviewed senior work and explored possible topic areas.\nProposed Ideas\nXinyue:\n\nTropical rainforest dynamics coverage analysis (rejected due to lack of data)\nSDG Goal 2 - Zero Hunger, focusing on food waste and world hunger statistics (initially agreed upon but later rejected due to difficulties collecting food waste data)\nWorld health issues (considered but rejected as most data only covered 2019 and 2022 with many missing values, making time series forecasting difficult)\n\nJing:\n\nSingapore population demographics analysis and forecast (rejected due to decreasing fertility rates and unpredictable immigration numbers)\nGerman population demographic shift analysis alongside policies for foreigners and immigrants (rejected due to unfamiliarity with German policies)\nWorld GDP analysis and time series forecast (rejected due to varying industry focuses across countries and the associated workload\nThe future of AI and workplace (rejected due to limited available data)\n\nMeihao:\n\nMaritime port import/export analysis focusing on Singapore’s trading relationships (rejected due to unclear motivation)\nTourism and CPI/exchange rate analysis for seasonal changes and tourist season forecasting (initially agreed upon but rejected due to difficulties obtaining historical exchange rates)\nHow do jet fuel price effect Singapore Airline Group’s Revenue( rejected due to difficulties obtaining historical Oil Price for a reliable source)\n\nSelected Topic\nAfter reviewing Xinyue’s data, the team generated the idea of exploring water-related issues. Relevant datasets were found, and the topic was selected. The team agreed to work on water sanitation issues such as:\n\nSufficient data is available for analysis\nThe topic includes appropriate variables for study\n\n2. Division of Tasks for Project Proposal\nAfter reviewing senior work, the team decided on the proposal structure and distributed responsibilities:\nJing:\n\nMotivation\nObjectives\nProblem statement\nData\nGitHub and Netlify setup\n\nXinyue:\n\nSketch of the prototypes and Explanation\nExpected contribution and impact\nConclusion\n\nMeihao:\n\nMethodology\nProject schedule\nRelevant work\nR package list\n\n3. Action Items\n\nAll members to push their work to GitHub for peer review\nJing will handle the final submission on Wednesday"
