### üåç Project Overview

**Access to safe water and sanitation remains one of the most pressing global health challenges.** As of 2022, 2.2 billion people lacked safely managed drinking water, and 3.5 billion lacked access to safe sanitation. These gaps contribute significantly to the spread of waterborne diseases such as **diarrhea, typhoid, and hepatitis**, especially in regions with underdeveloped infrastructure and fragile public health systems.

Despite global efforts under **Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6)** ‚Äî which aims for universal access to clean water and sanitation ‚Äî progress has been **uneven and insufficient**, underscoring the need for data-driven strategies to address widening global disparities.

### üéØ Objective

This project aims to:

-   **Uncover hidden patterns** in water and sanitation access and their link to disease incidence,

-   Analyze **temporal and regional disparities** in water infrastructure and health outcomes,

-   Uncover **key drivers of waterborne disease** using panel data modeling and interactive data visualization tools.

### ‚úÖ Key Outcomes

-   **Sanitation** access showed strong **positive correlation with reduced diarrhea and typhoid incidence**.

-   **Open defecation** was consistently associated with **higher disease rates**, highlighting it as a significant public health risk.

-   **Basic water and sanitation services** significantly reduced disease burden, especially after 2010.

-   Regional disparities remain stark, with **Sub-Saharan Africa** and **South Asia** showing **lower access and higher disease incidence** compared to other regions.

-   Developed an **interactive Shiny app** for exploring disease-WASH relationships by **region, year, and indicator**.
